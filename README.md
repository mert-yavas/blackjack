# Blackjack Game
## Overview
Hello! I'm Mert, and this is Day 11 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. Today, I'm excited to showcase a Blackjack game I've developed. This Python script simulates the popular casino card game, challenging players against an automated dealer.

## How It Works
The Blackjack game follows standard rules and is easy to play:

* **Start Game:** The game begins by dealing two cards each to the player and the dealer.
* **Player's Turn:** As a player, you can choose to 'hit' (take another card) or 'stand' (end your turn).
* **Dealer's Turn:** The dealer automatically hits if their total is below 17.
* **Compare Scores:** Once both player and dealer have finished, scores are compared to determine the winner.
* **Game End:** The game ends if you or the dealer go over a score of 21 ('bust') or choose to stand.

## Features
* **Unlimited Deck:** The deck is unlimited, mimicking an infinite number of standard card decks.
* **Automated Dealer:** The dealer follows fixed rules, making the gameplay fair and consistent.
* **User Decisions:** Players make real-time decisions to hit or stand.
* **Score Calculation:** Automated calculation of card values, including special rules for Aces.
* **Game Restart:** Option to restart the game after each round.

## Required Libraries and Files
To run the Blackjack game, you need:

* **art.py:** This file contains ASCII art for the game's visual elements, enhancing the user experience.

## How to Play
Run the script, and follow the on-screen instructions to play Blackjack. Make your move by typing 'hit' or 'stand', and see if you can beat the dealer!

## Conclusion
Whether you're a Blackjack enthusiast or new to the game, this Python version offers a fun and engaging way to enjoy the game. Test your strategy, take risks, and see if luck is on your side in this classic game of Blackjack!
